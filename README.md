# üõí E-commerce Checkout System ‚Äì Microservices in Go

This is a containerized **E-commerce Checkout System** built using **Go (Golang)**. It follows a **microservices architecture** with independent REST APIs for **Product**, **Cart**, and **Order** services. Each service has its own **MySQL** database and is orchestrated using **Docker Compose**.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The system consists of three microservices:

- **Product Service**: Manage product creation and listing.
- **Cart Service**: Handle cart operations.
- **Order Service**: Place and view orders.

Each microservice is:

- Written in Go using the **Gin** framework
- Uses **sqlx** for database interactions
- Runs in its own Docker container
